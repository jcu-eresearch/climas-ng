    This tool was developed by a team at
    <a href="http://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/">JCU's eResearch Centre</a>
    and uses species occurrence data from the
    <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a> and
    climate data from <a href="http://climascope.tyndall.ac.uk">ClimaScope</a>
    and the <a href="http://www.eoc.csiro.au/awap/">Australian Water Availability Project</a>.
</p><p>
    The principal researcher and project advisor was Dr Jeremy VanDerWal.

    The project that produced this tool was supported by
    the Department of the Environment through the
    Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund and
    through engagement with Rangelands, Territory NRM,
    Southern Gulf Catchments, Northern Gulf Resource Management Group,
    and NQ Dry Tropics.
