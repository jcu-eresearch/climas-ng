<h2>About this tool</h2>
<p>
	The Wallace Initiative was set up to look at the potential impacts 
	of climate change on as broad of range of biodiversity as possible. 
	It brought together experts in climate impacts, climate model data 
	and species modelling to look at the potential impacts of climate 
	change on now close to 100,000 species. It has been used in a 
	number of studies, see <span class="draft">yyyy</span>.
</p><p>
	This tool, based on the 
	<a href="http://climas.hpc.jcu.edu.au">CliMAS</a> tool developed 
	at James Cook University, provides interactive maps and regional 
	reports to examine the future of species distributions and 
	biodiversity around the world.

	It summarises mapped biodiversity of almost 100,000 mammals, birds, 
	reptiles, amphibians, plants and some insects (e.g., pollinators) 
	within their suitable climate space projected by 21 different 
	Global Climate Models (GCMs) at global warming levels of 1.5&deg;, 
	2&deg;, 2.7&deg;, 3.2&deg;, 4.5&deg; and 6&deg; C above 
	pre-industrial. These temperatures span the 
	<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Accord</a> 
	goals (1.5&deg; to 2&deg;), the temperatures estimated to be 
	reached under the current Paris Pledges (the Nationally Determined 
	Commitments, 2.7&deg; to 3.2&deg; C), a typical Business as Usual 
	Scenario (4.5&deg; C) and an extreme scenario covering a case of 
	high climate sensitivity or feedbacks (6&deg; C). These are drawn 
	from the AVOID scenario temperature distributions equivalent to 
	the IPCC RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. Please see 
	<span class="draft">xxx</span>
	for more details on the links between the temperatures and the 
	scenarios. Detailed lists of potential climate space losses and 
	gains for each species may be obtained in the reports section.

<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>
	The map section of Wallace offers projected species distribution 
	and biodiversity maps.  Each map type is offered for the specific 
	warming levels above, allowing or not allowing for species 
	movements (dispersal) at realistic rates, and either the 10th, 
	50th or 90th percentile across the set of models used to project 
	the future climate (to span some of the climate model uncertainty).
	See the <a href="/science">Science page</a> for more information.
</p><p>
	In additon, easy comparisons can be made by loading two maps and 
	switching between them, demonstrated in the animation below which 
	compares current and future distributions of the Northern Blossom 
	Bat.

<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>
	The report section of the Wallace Initiative offers a discussion 
	of projected changes to climate and biodiversity for a specified 
	region.  Reports are generated using the same data represented 
	on the Wallace Initiative maps.  Reports are customisable, to 
	allow for a focus on a specific warming amount or species taxon.
</p><p>
	This enables visitors to investigate climate change in their 
	region and to determine priority species and places.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
	Currently there is a general lack of engagement and knowledge 
	transfer between professional researchers and the end-users 
	of research (general public, conservation managers, 
	decision-makers, etc.). This is reflected in a general lack 
	of acceptance and acknowledgement by the public and 
	stakeholders of the potential impacts of climate change, 
	particularly on biodiversity.
</p><p>
	Recently, researchers have begun to endeavour to make the 
	results of their research public, however there is a scarcity 
	of online tools that display species distribution data.  
	The Wallace Initiative provides a tool that exposes data 
	available with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
	(GBIF) and its partners, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), 
	Tyndall Climate Change Centre, and the Tropical Data Hub in 
	a visual and interactive way, to allow a broad range of 
	end-users to explore the potential impacts of climate change 
	on terrestrial vertebrate species in their region.
